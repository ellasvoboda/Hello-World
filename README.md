## Project Title
Womens Sports Spending in the US
Business Analytics Group Project
## Description
Within this project, we looked at a Kaggle dataset displaying information about womens sports. This includes how much money colleges spend on womens sports compared to mens sports, along with information about the location, type, and size of the college so we could identify trends. We used regression analysis, correlation, and hypothesis testing to analyze the data. One outcome we found was that schools with football tend to spend significantly less on womens sports.
